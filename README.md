SETUP
- open terminal inside project folder and execute command: "npm install"
- after above command execute command: "npm start"
- now your default browser will get opened and the web page will gets load



FOR PDF UPLOADS:
- create folder as per unit name like: UNIT_1 (create folder under public foler)
- then under that folder paster pdf as per topic names and update the link in the code also
- for example there's only one topic "topic2" is placed under "UNIT_1" folder

POPUP GLITCH
- there's a popup glitch in the code
- to deal with it, simply dont mention any invalid pdf link
- only mention valid links, as for valid links it will open pdf in popup, otherwise it will replicate same web page again and again in a loop

CUURENT PROJECT STATE
- currently it only works for UNIT 1
- you can check the "App.js" file for reference as there's only one component is called that it "Unit1"
